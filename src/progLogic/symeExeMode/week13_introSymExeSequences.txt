HW 12 due at midnight tonight

HW 13 will be posted after class -- due Thursday, December 2

No office hours over Fall Break

I'll have limited availability starting Friday afternoon and over the break.
    --> if you have questions, I suggest posting them to Discord.
        Another student may be able to help you out.

Exams will be returned the Tuesday after the break.

////////////////////////////

Logika modes.

Default/manual mode - what we've been doing.

SymExe mode - only needs function contracts and invariant blocks.
    --> can do all intermediate reasoning itself.

**See how to switch modes

For SymExe:

File->Settings->Tools->Sireum->Logika
    Auto is checked
    Checker kind is "summarizing symexe"

////////////////////////////

Example: See what we can change in factorial verification.



**All HW 12 problems should be done in manual mode,
    but remaining homework will use SymExe mode

///////////////////////////

More with Logika facts, using SymeExe.

Example: multiplication, but using a Logika fact

result == m*n

////////////////////////////

Sequences. (like an array or list)

--> see Logika sequence operations

--> sequences are passed to a function by reference
    --> postcondition should describe how a sequence changes

///////////////////////////

Example: function that sets first element in a sequence to 0


///////////////////////////

Example: function that sets some position in a sequence to 0

//////////////////////////

Functions with sequences and loops.
--> same idea, but loop invariant block needs to describe
    what has been changed so far about the sequence (and what
    has not been changed)

Example: function that sets every position in a sequence to 10



**We have covered everything needed to do #1-#3 on HW 13
    (we will do something similar to #4 after the break)

Rest of time: feel free to stick around and ask HW 12 questions
