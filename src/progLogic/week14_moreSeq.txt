Exam 3.

Average: 75% (not including students who didn't take exam)

High: 78 (I think...)

A (72-80): 17 students
B (64-71): 24 students
C (56-63): 16 students
D (48-55): 9 students
F (47 and under): 17 students (plus 6 students who did not take exam)

Work through exam.

How to improve?
- Come to class!
- Make sure you understand the solution / what you missed
- Rework exam problems on your own (without looking at the solution)
- Do the same for previous exams as well
- If there was a particular area you didn't understand,
    review the notes from those days. Rework any examples on your own.

Review: write a swap function for a sequence


l"""{
    requires
    modifies
    ensures
}"""

How to reference the original (parameter) version of sequence?

What should we always state about the sequence size?

How to specify a range of indices?
    A x: (start..<end) (say something about seq(x), seq_in(x))

Can also do:
    A x: (start..<end) (something about x) ->
                        (something about seq(x), seq_in(x))

///////////////////////////////

Review: verify a function that adds 1 to all elements in a sequence


//////////////////////////////

Harder example: verify a function that returns the sum of elements
    in a sequence

Look at HW 13 problems
