HW 14 is due tonight

result -> (the sequence is sorted)
!result -> (the sequence is not sorted)

Final exam is Wednesday, December 15
    2:00-3:50 pm in the usual lecture classroom (DUE 1109)

Cumulative.
Similar format as the midterms exams (multiple choice + open-ended).
Can bring one 8.5"x11" sheet of handwritten notes.

The final exam is worth 25% of your overall grade.

/////////////////////////////////////

- Introduction to logical reasoning
    - Basic logical reasoning
    - Knights and knaves puzzles
- Propositional logic
    - Translating between English and propositional logic
    - Truth tables, top-level operators,
            tautology/contingent/contradictory, satisfiability
    - Propositional logic proofs
        and, or, implies, and negation rules
    - Semantic entailment (uses truth tables)
        p semantically entails q if p->q is a tautology
    - Logical equivalence (with proofs and with truth tables)
    - Soundness and completeness
        soundness: anything that I can prove (with proof rules)
                    is actually true

        completeness: everything that is true can be proved
- Predicate logic
    - Universal and existential quantifiers
    - Translating between English and predicate logic
    - Predicate logic proofs with Ai, Ae, Ei, and Ee rules
        (including those with more than one variable
        and/or nested quantifiers)
- Programming logic (I'll specify manual/symexe for each problem)
    - Assumes and asserts
    - The subst rules
    - The algebra rule
    - Verifying asserts with variables/expressions/updating variables
        (including claims with division and modulus)
    - Verifying programs with if/else statements, functions,
        loops, recursion, sequences, and global variables/invariants
    - Function contracts
    - Loop invariant blocks
    - Verifying "test code" that calls a function
    - Interpreting and using Logika facts
    - Full vs. partial correctness, and proving termination


I strongly recommend reworking previous exams,
going through previous exam review problems, and reworking
previous homework problems.

These practice problems do not cover all exam topics.

Translations:

I drive to work only if it is below freezing or my bicycle is broken.

p: I drive to work
q: It is below freezing
r: My bicycle is broken

if [neither exception is true], then I don't drive to work.

!(q V r) -> !p


OR

p -> (q V r)



////////////////

Domain: food

C(x, y): x costs more than y
P(x): x is produce
V(x): x is a vegetable
F(x): x is a frozen food

All vegetables are produce.

A x (V(x) -> P(x))


Some vegetables are not frozen.

E x (V(x) ^ !F(x))


Not all produce foods are vegetables.

there exists a produce that is not a vegetable

E x (P(x) ^ !V(x))
!(A x (P(x) -> V(x)))

There is no frozen food that costs more than every vegetable.

!(E x (F(x) ^ (A y (V(y) -> C(x, y)))))
