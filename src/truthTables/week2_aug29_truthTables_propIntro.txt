HW 1 due Thursday, September 2

//////////////////////////

Write truth table in Logika:

p -> q V !r ^ p

!, ^, V, ->


///////////////////////////

Write truth table in Logika:

p V q ^ r ^ q -> !p

try this one on your own

!
the left ^
the right ^
the V
the ->

top-level (last applied) operator: ->

if Tautology or Contradictory

don't have to put the T/F entries afterwards

//////////////////////////

Equivalent statements

p -> q
!p V q
!q -> !p

**what would be sample English statements?

p: I stay up late
q: I will be tired

p -> q
If I stay up late, then I will be tired.

!p V q
I don't stay up late and/or I am tired.

!q -> !p
If I'm not tired, then I didn't stay up late.

How could we show they were equivalent with truth tables?


//////////////////////////

Propositional logic
- a set of propositions (statements that can be T/F)
- connected by logical operators

To translate:
1) Identify all propositional atoms in the sentence,
    assign letters to them
2) Make sure propositional atoms don't include logical
    operators (like "not")
3) Translate to propositional statements with appropriate
    operators




//////////////////////////

Negation (NOT): look for "un", "ir", "not" in sentence

**Example: I am not going to work today.

Atom:
p: I am going to work today.

Translation:
!p







//////////////////////////

Conjunction (AND): look for "and", "but", "however",
    "moreover", "nevertheless", etc.



**Example: I am hungry and thirsty.

Atoms:
p: I am hungry
q: I am thirsty

Translation:
p ^ q



**Example: I am short but John is not tall.

Atoms:
p: I am short
q: John is tall

Translation:
p ^ !q




//////////////////////////

Disjunction (OR): look for "or", interpret whether the or
is inclusive or exclusive. Usually inclusive.



**Example: You can watch a movie and/or eat a snack.

Atoms:
p: You can watch a movie
q: You can eat a snack

Translation:
p V q





**Example: You can have chips or fries, but not both.

Atoms:
p: You can have chips
q: You can have fries

Translation:
(p V q) ^ !(p ^ q)








**Example: Fred neither washed the car nor
    went to the mechanic.

Atoms:
p: Fred washed the car
q: Fred went to the mechanic

Translation:

!(p V q)

!p ^ !q



**In this class, it's safe to assume "or" is inclusive
    unless otherwise clearly specified.

///////////////////////////////////////////

Implication (IMPLIES): look for "if...then", "provided...then",
    "only...", "given...", "assuming...", "unless..."

**Pay attention to what is being promised, like:
    (given this condition) -> (we can infer this conclusion)




**Example: If it is hot today, then I'll get ice cream.

Atoms:
p: It is hot today
q: I'll get ice cream

Translation:
p -> q





**Example: You can login to a CS lab computer if you have
    a CS account.

Atoms:
p: You can login to a CS computer
q: you have a CS account

Translation:

q -> p







**Example: Wilma eats cookies only if Evelyn makes them.

Atoms:
p: Wilma eats cookies
q: Evelyn makes cookies

Translation:
p -> q






**Example: I will go to the beach unless it is raining.

Atoms:
p: I will go to the beach
q: It is raining

Translation:
if it isn't raining, I promise I'll go to the beach

!q -> p

!p -> q










**Example: If it is nice tomorrow, then I'll go for a run,
    but only if I don't feel tired.

Atoms:
p: It is nice tomorrow
q: I'll go for a run
r: I feel tired

Translation:

(p ^ !r) -> q






**Example: If it snows today, I will go sledding;
    otherwise, I'll stay inside.

Atoms:
p: It snows today
q: I will go sledding
r: I'll stay inside

Translation:

(p -> q) ^ (!p -> r)








**Example: I will not like radishes unless my tastes change
    or I learn to cook them in another way.

Atoms:
p: I like radishes
q: My tastes change
r: I learn to cook them in another way

Translation:

!(q V r) -> !p






//////////////////////////////////
Summary:

p: I swim
q: It is hot


IF p THEN q:
    if I swim, then it is hot

    p -> q


p ONLY IF q:
    I swim only if it is hot

    !q -> !p
    p -> q

p IF q:
    I swim if it is hot

    q -> p

p UNLESS q:
    I swim unless it is hot

    !q -> p
    !p -> q

//////////////////////////////////

Contrapositive.

p->q is logically equivalent to !q->!p


//////////////////////////////////

Implication as a disjunction.

p->q is logically equivalent to !p V q




...BUT! We should still build our translations to match
the English sentence as well as we can.


////////////////////////////////////

Knights and knaves with truth tables

Eve says, ”I am a knave or Fred is a knight.”

Eve knight, Fred, knight

e, f
e - e is a knight
!e - e is knave
f - f is a knight
!f - fred is a knave

e -> (!e V f)
!e -> !(!e V f)

(e -> (!e V f)) ^ (!e -> !(!e V f))





/////////////////////////

Ava says that Bob is a knave.
Bob says, ”Neither Ava nor I are knaves.”

a: Ava is a knight (!a: Ava is a knave)
b: Bob is a knight (!b: Bob is a knave)

a -> !b
!a -> !!b
b -> !(!a V !b)
!b -> !!(!a V !b)

statement: (a -> !b) ^ (!a -> !!b) ^ (b -> !(!a V !b)) ^ (!b -> !!(!a V !b))
