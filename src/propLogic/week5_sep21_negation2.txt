HW 4 is due Thursday, September 23

HW 2 comments
    - Considering (!p -> !q) or (q -> p) equivalent to (p -> q)
    - Considering  “p if q” equivalent to “p only if q”
    - Considering "unless" as "if",
    - Misusing ^e (trying to use cases like Ve)
        and Ve (trying to use like ^e)

Exam 1 breakdown.

I added 3 pts to everyone's base score.

Avg: 59/80 (a 74%)
High: 83/80 (3 students had perfect scores)

A (72+): 32
B (64-71): 8
C (56-63): 11
D (48-55): 15
F (47 and below): 25

Working through Exam 1

Negation rules in propositional logic.

Not-elimination:

        P    !P
!e:    ----------
          _|_


Not-introduction:

        {P assume
          ... _|_ }
!i:    -------------
           !P


Bottom-elimination:

          _|_
_|_e:  ----------
           R


Proof by contradiction (reductio ad absurdum):

       {!P assume
        ... _|_}
pbc:  ----------
          P

///////////////////////////

¬ ¬ p ⊢ p

p ∨ q, ¬p ⊢ q

¬ (¬ p ∨ ¬ q)  ⊢ p ∧ q

⊢ p ∨ ¬ p

p → q ⊢ ¬ p ∨ q

Revisiting...how do we approach proofs?

First, look at the premises:
    - AND statements: break them apart now
    - IMPLIES statements: if you can already use ->e, do so now
    - NOT statements: if you already have a contradiction, use
        !e to get a _|_
    - everything else: keep them in mind, don't do anything yet

Then, look at the conclusion (top-level operator):
    - AND statement: will need to tackle each side separately,
        then use ^i to put them together
    - IMPLIES statement: immediately open a block and assume
        the LHS of the implies. Try to get to the RHS by the
        end of the block, and then use ->i
        --> pretend you're starting a new proof here where your
            goal is to prove the RHS
    - OR statement:
        - if you can get it with Vi from any previous
            statement, do so now
        - otherwise, might need a different approach
    - NOT statement: immediately open a block and assume the
        statement IS true. Try to get to a contradiction by
        the end of the block, and then use !i
        --> pretend you're starting a new proof here where your
            goal is to get a contradiction

Nothing applies?
    - See if you have any V statements available that you
        haven't processed. Try using Ve on them.
        --> remember you need the same conclusion in both blocks!
    - Might try using pbc (assume what you're trying to prove
        ISN'T true, and try to get a contradiction)
    - *maybe* try first putting the proof for p V !p,
        and using Ve


...and sometimes you have to experiment! If you're not getting
anywhere, try a different approach.
